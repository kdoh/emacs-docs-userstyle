emacs-docs-userstyle
====================

A custom user style to make browsing the Emacs docs a bit nicer.

## Motivation

As I've been trying to learn Emacs and Emacs lisp I've found the content of the docs are fantastic but the default layout makes reading and understanding more difficult than itneeds to be.

## Issues
I admittedly haven't browsed all the docs. If you encounter a page that looks odd as a result of this userstyle please file an issue with the page url or (even better) submit pull-request.
